- Summary tooltip on hover in VideoCardView + summary improved to `.secondary` color and 2-line limit
- Editor info sidebar panel (title, full summary, metadata) toggled via `(i)` button in right sidebar
- Webcam unmirrored in both live preview bubble and recorded video (horizontal flip with correct CIImage extent)
- Accessibility permission prompt moved to app startup (`CloomApp.init`); monitors check silently
- API key storage switched from Keychain to `~/Library/Application Support/Cloom/api_key` (file-based, `chmod 600`) — eliminates repeated Keychain prompts on debug rebuilds
- Waveform amplitude boost: peaks normalized relative to loudest peak + `sqrt` curve for quiet speech visibility
- Audio recording fix: separated audio onto dedicated `audioQueue` so annotation rendering on video queue doesn't stutter/block audio
- Added `.help()` tooltips to all editor toolbar buttons (Play, Stitch, Export) and recording toolbar (Stop)

**Milestone verified:** Organized library with interactive sidebar (folders + tags), full-text search, 7 sort options, transcript filter, video context menus (copy path, show in Finder, move to folder, tags, delete), bulk operations (move, tag, delete), hover preview effect on cards. Build succeeds with 0 code warnings.

- [x] Redesigned VideoCardView (duration badge overlay, cleaner typography, subtle hover brightness)
- [x] Added Theme colors (durationBadge, listRowHover, cardBackgroundSubtle)
- [x] Updated ProcessingCardView to match new card style
- [x] Tag pills: max 2 shown, thinner capsules

### Phase 4: Polish + Cleanup
- [x] Deleted legacy PlayerView.swift + Player/ directory
- [x] Added opacity transitions between Library ↔ Editor
- [x] Edge case: video deleted while in editor → auto-navigate back to library
- [x] Escape key returns to library from editor
- [x] ViewStyle persisted to UserDefaults
- [x] Ran xcodegen generate for new files
- [x] Updated plan docs (02-project-structure.md, 05-swift-modules.md)

### New Files
- `CloomApp/Sources/App/NavigationState.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/App/MainWindowView.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Library/LibraryContentView.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Library/LibraryListRowView.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Editor/EditorContentView.swift`

### Deleted Files
- `CloomApp/Sources/Library/LibraryView.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Editor/EditorView.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Player/PlayerView.swift`

**Milestone verified:** Build succeeds (0 errors, 1 warning). Single-window navigation with library ↔ editor mode switching. Grid/list toggle. Visual redesign with duration badges, clean typography, subtle hover effects. Back navigation via chevron button, Cmd+[, or Escape. Sidebar visible in both modes.

## Phase 19: Pre-Recording Setup Flow
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-02-27

- [x] Task 129 — Add "ready" state to RecordingState (new `.ready` case + `isReady` computed property)
- [x] Task 130 — Update RecordingCoordinator to enter ready state on "Start Recording" (`beginPreRecordingFlow()` → `.ready` state, `showReadyToolbar()`, webcam preview if camera enabled; skips screen capture permission check for webcam-only mode)
- [x] Task 131 — Add record button to recording toolbar (ReadyToolbarContentView with green "Ready" indicator, mic/camera/annotations/click-emphasis/spotlight toggles, red circle record button, cancel X button; `showReady()` method on RecordingToolbarPanel)
- [x] Task 132 — Camera preview in ready state (`startWebcam()` called in ready state; `toggleCamera()` updated to work in `.ready` state without touching capture service)
- [x] Task 133 — Cancel from ready state (`cancelReadyState()` stops webcam, dismisses toolbar, cleans up annotations, returns to `.idle`)
- [x] Task 134 — Update menu bar and global hotkeys (Cmd+Shift+R: idle → ready → recording → stop; menu bar shows "Start Recording" + "Cancel Setup" in ready state; `menuStatusText` shows "Ready to record...")

### Additional Changes
- [x] Removed BubbleControlPill from webcam bubble (no longer needed — controls are on the toolbar)
- [x] Fixed onboarding window not auto-presenting after TCC reset (`.defaultLaunchBehavior` now checks `permissionChecker.requiredGranted` in addition to `hasCompletedOnboarding`)

### Files Modified
- `RecordingState.swift` — added `.ready` case + `isReady`
- `RecordingCoordinator.swift` — added `confirmRecording()`, `cancelReadyState()`; removed `bubbleControlPill` property + dismiss calls
- `RecordingCoordinator+Capture.swift` — `beginPreRecordingFlow()` → `.ready` state; extracted `enterReadyState()` helper; removed pill creation from `beginWebcamOnlyCapture()`
- `RecordingCoordinator+UI.swift` — added `showReadyToolbar()`; removed pill dismiss from `performDiscard()`
- `RecordingCoordinator+Toggles.swift` — toggles work in `.ready` state (preview only)
- `RecordingCoordinator+Webcam.swift` — removed pill dismiss from `stopWebcam()`
- `RecordingCoordinator+CaptureDelegate.swift` — removed pill creation from `captureDidStart()` + dismiss from `captureDidFail()`
- `RecordingToolbarPanel.swift` — added `showReady()` + `ReadyToolbarContentView`
- `CloomApp.swift` — ready state menu bar branch; fixed onboarding `.defaultLaunchBehavior`
- `AppState.swift` — `confirmRecording()` / `cancelReadyState()` passthroughs; hotkey update

**Milestone verified:** Build succeeds (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning). Start Recording → Ready toolbar → toggle controls → click record → countdown → capture. Cancel returns to idle. Hotkeys cycle correctly. Onboarding auto-presents when permissions missing.

## Phase 21: Google Drive Integration
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-02-27

Manual upload-to-Google-Drive with shareable links. Google Sign-In SDK for OAuth, Swift actor for resumable uploads, file-based token backup via SDK Keychain.

- [x] Task 150 — Data model: 4 optional cloud fields on VideoRecord (driveFileId, shareUrl, uploadStatus, uploadedAt) + UploadStatus enum
- [x] Task 145 — Google OAuth: GoogleSignIn-iOS SPM package, GoogleAuthConfig, GoogleAuthService (@Observable @MainActor singleton), onOpenURL handler, session restore in AppDelegate
- [x] Task 149 — Settings > Cloud tab: OAuth Client ID TextField, Google account connect/disconnect, status display
- [x] Task 146 — DriveUploadService actor: resumable upload with 5MB chunks, retry with exponential backoff, share link creation, file deletion; DriveUploadManager (@Observable @MainActor singleton) coordinates uploads with progress tracking
- [x] Task 147 — Upload integrated into Export sheet: "Upload to Drive" button in EditorExportView (exports with settings then uploads), library context menu retains raw upload
- [x] Task 148 — Cloud status indicators: VideoCardView (green link icon / progress / red error), LibraryListRowView (same), EditorInfoPanel (Cloud section with share link + copy button + upload date)

### New Files (7)
- `CloomApp/Sources/Data/UploadStatus.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Cloud/GoogleAuthConfig.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Cloud/GoogleAuthService.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Cloud/DriveUploadService.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Cloud/DriveUploadManager.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Settings/CloudSettingsTab.swift`
- `CloomTests/CloudTests.swift`

### Deleted Files (1)
- `CloomApp/Sources/Cloud/ShareUploadButton.swift` — merged into EditorExportView

### Modified Files (12)
- `VideoModel.swift` (+4 optional fields)
- `project.yml` (+GoogleSignIn SPM package)
- `Info.plist` (+CFBundleURLTypes for OAuth)
- `CloomApp.swift` (+onOpenURL, +restoreSession)
- `SettingsView.swift` (+Cloud tab)
- `EditorToolbarView.swift` (-ShareUploadButton, upload moved to export sheet)
- `EditorExportView.swift` (+Upload to Drive button, progress, success state)
- `DriveUploadManager.swift` (+uploadExportedFile, refactored shared performUpload)

Upload merged into Export sheet (exports with settings then uploads to Drive). Library context menu retains raw upload. Status indicators on cards/list/info panel. 6 new unit tests.

---

## Phase 22: Export Speed Optimization
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-02-28

### Quick Fixes
- [x] Task 151 — Use SharedCIContext in export (replaced throwaway CIContext with SharedCIContext.instance singleton)

### Passthrough Export
- [x] Task 152 — Passthrough detection for unmodified exports (isExportUnmodified() checks trim/cuts/speed/brightness/contrast; unmodified + no subs → FileManager.copyItem; unmodified + subs → ExportWriter.remuxWithSubtitles)

### Subtitle Overhaul
- [x] Task 153 — Replace hard-burn + SRT with embedded tx3g subtitle track (ExportWriter enum with static methods for remux + edited export; tx3g binary format with CMSampleBuffer; simplified UI to "Include Subtitles" toggle)
- [x] Task 156 — Clean up SubtitleExportService (removed SubtitleMode enum, hard-burn rendering, SRT generation, CIImage compositing; kept SubtitlePhrase, buildPhrases, mapToCompositionTime; ~241 lines → ~80 lines)

### Parallelization
- [x] Task 154 — Parallel GIF frame extraction (sliding window of 8 concurrent tasks via withThrowingTaskGroup; SendableGenerator wrapper for thread-safe AVAssetImageGenerator access)
- [x] Task 155 — Parallel segment metadata loading in SegmentStitcher (withThrowingTaskGroup loads all segment durations + tracks concurrently, sorted by index for sequential insertion)

### New Files
- `CloomApp/Sources/Editor/ExportWriter.swift`

### Modified Files
- `CloomApp/Sources/Editor/EditorExportView.swift` — subtitle toggle, passthrough detection, ExportWriter integration, removed hard-burn/SRT code
- `CloomApp/Sources/Editor/SubtitleExportService.swift` — removed SubtitleMode, hard-burn, SRT, rendering code (~241→80 lines)
- `CloomApp/Sources/Editor/GifExportService.swift` — parallel frame extraction with sliding window
- `CloomApp/Sources/Compositing/SegmentStitcher.swift` — parallel segment metadata loading

**Milestone verified:** Build succeeds (0 errors, 53 pre-existing warnings). Passthrough for unmodified exports (instant file copy). Embedded tx3g subtitles (no re-encode for unmodified). Parallel GIF and segment loading.

---

- [x] Fixed version test: `assert_eq!(version, env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))`

### Task 2: Open Source Boilerplate (partial)
- [x] Created LICENSE (MIT, copyright 2025 Sachin Rajput)
- [x] Created README.md (description, features, requirements, build instructions, architecture)
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CHANGELOG.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, GitHub templates — skipped (user will write)

### Task 3: OAuth Client ID Build-Time Injection
- [x] Created `Secrets.xcconfig.example` template for Google OAuth build-time variables
- [x] Added `Secrets.xcconfig` to `.gitignore`
- [x] Replaced hardcoded OAuth Client ID in Info.plist with `$(GOOGLE_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID)`
- [x] Added `configFiles` to project.yml (Debug/Release) + fallback empty build settings
- [x] Renamed `Secrets.example` → `Secrets.swift.example` (non-compilable extension) with xcconfig instructions
- [x] Added build.sh logic: auto-derives `GOOGLE_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` from `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`; warns if xcconfig missing

### Task 4: CI Fixes
- [x] Changed swift-tests `runs-on: macos-26` → `macos-15` (latest stable)
- [x] Removed redundant second xcodebuild run

### Task 5: Code Quality — File Splits
- [x] Created `ExportService.swift` (132 lines) — extracted exportMP4, presetForQuality, isExportUnmodified from EditorExportView
- [x] Rewrote `EditorExportView.swift` (332 lines) — calls ExportService, body split into computed properties
- [x] Created `ExportWriter+Subtitles.swift` (177 lines) — extracted subtitle methods + shared makeTx3gFormatDescription
- [x] Rewrote `ExportWriter.swift` (260 lines) — removed subtitle methods, made track copying static
- [x] Created `RecordingToolbarContentView.swift` (137 lines) — recording-state toolbar view
- [x] Created `ReadyToolbarContentView.swift` (95 lines) — ready-state toolbar view
- [x] Created `ToolbarToggleButton.swift` (22 lines) — reusable toggle button
- [x] Rewrote `RecordingToolbarPanel.swift` (123 lines) — NSPanel management only

### Task 6: Bug Fixes & Cleanup
- [x] Fixed presetForQuality bug, removed debug UI, dead code, and 17 silent `try?` sites
- [x] Extracted recordingTimestamp() helper, moved NSAlert out of AIOrchestrator

### Task 7: Test Coverage Improvements
- [x] Fixed RecordingSettingsTests: `fromDefaultsReturnsValidSettings` calls `RecordingSettings.fromDefaults()`
- [x] Migrated CacheTests from XCTest to Swift Testing
- [x] Created FFIBridgeTests.swift (helloFromRust + cloomCoreVersion semver)
- [x] Created LibraryFilterTests.swift (7 LibrarySortOrder comparators + TranscriptFilter)
- [x] Fixed silence_tests.rs: eprintln → panic for decoder failures
- [x] Fixed ExportService to take value types (filePath, EDLSnapshot) instead of @Model types (Swift 6 sending errors)
- [x] Added missing CoreGraphics, CoreImage, Foundation imports in test files (needed after XCTest → Swift Testing migration)

### Task 8: Plan Docs & Memory Update
- [x] Updated all 11 plan docs to remove GIF references, add new files, fix test counts

**Milestone verified:** 38 Rust tests pass. 56 Swift tests pass. Build succeeds. GIF export fully removed. MIT license added. OAuth Client ID injected at build time with auto-derived reversed ID. CI simplified. Files split for SRP compliance. Bug fixes applied. Test coverage improved.

---

## Phase 24: Test Coverage
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-01

**Goal:** Close critical test coverage gaps. Focus on pure algorithmic logic that can be unit-tested without hardware, AV frameworks, or network mocking.

### Refactoring for Testability
- [x] Added memberwise `EDLSnapshot` initializer (for test construction without SwiftData models)
- [x] Extracted `EditorCompositionBuilder.buildTimeRanges` to static function
- [x] Changed `SubtitleExportService.mapToCompositionTime` from private to static
- [x] Extracted `WaveformGenerator.applyNoiseFloor` to static function
- [x] Extracted `calculateChunkCount` and `calculateChunkDuration` from `AudioExtractor`

### Bug Fix Discovered by Tests
- [x] Fixed `EditorCompositionBuilder.buildTimeRanges` — see [BUGS.md #34](BUGS.md#34--cuts-at-timeline-start-silently-skipped-in-buildtimeranges) for details

### Priority 1 — CRITICAL (pure logic, zero tests)
- [x] Task 157 — Export pipeline tests (14 tests): `ExportService.isExportUnmodified` (11 condition tests), `presetForQuality` (3 mapping tests)
- [x] Task 158 — Subtitle timing tests (11 tests): `SubtitleExportService.mapToCompositionTime` (offset, cuts, trim, speed, clamping, edge cases)
- [x] Task 159 — Caption/transcript grouping tests (19 tests): `CaptionOverlayView.buildPhrases` (9 tests: empty, word count, time threshold, timing), `TranscriptPanelView.groupIntoSentences` (10 tests: punctuation, overflow, paragraphs)
- [x] Task 160 — AI orchestrator tests (15 tests): `buildTimestampedTranscript` (8 tests: formatting, timestamps, edge cases), `findParagraphStartIndices` (7 tests: nil, single/multi paragraphs, bounds)
- [x] Task 161 — Recording state tests (27 tests): all 7 computed properties tested across all 7 enum cases + Equatable
- [x] Task 162 — Editor composition tests (11 tests): `buildTimeRanges` (no cuts, trim, single/multiple cuts, cut at start/end, unsorted, clamped)

### Priority 2 — HIGH (pure math, easy wins)
- [x] Task 163 — Capture math tests (17 tests): `MicGainProcessor` (7 tests: sensitivity→isUnity, clamping), `WebcamShape` (10 tests: aspectRatio, cornerRadius, next cycling, displayNames, allCases)
- [x] Task 164 — Missing sort order tests: added `oldestFirst` to `LibraryFilterTests` (1 test)
- [x] Task 165 — AI processing tracker tests (7 tests): start/stop/isProcessing, multiple IDs, idempotency, stop-without-start

### Priority 3 — MEDIUM (extractable logic)
- [x] Task 166 — Waveform noise floor tests (8 tests): empty, all-zero, sensitivity multiplier, mixed speech/noise, clamping
- [x] Task 167 — Audio chunking tests (12 tests): `calculateChunkCount` (7 tests: small/equal/double/over/triple/zero), `calculateChunkDuration` (5 tests: single/multi/zero/uneven)
- [x] Task 168 — Rust LLM tests (7 new tests): parse_chapters edge cases (whitespace, negative start_ms, large values, single, many, trailing text), truncate_transcript (empty, single char)

### New Test Files (10)
- `CloomTests/ExportServiceTests.swift`
- `CloomTests/SubtitleTimingTests.swift`
- `CloomTests/CaptionGroupingTests.swift`
- `CloomTests/AITextProcessingTests.swift`
- `CloomTests/RecordingStateTests.swift`
- `CloomTests/EditorCompositionTests.swift`
- `CloomTests/CaptureMathTests.swift`
- `CloomTests/AIProcessingTrackerTests.swift`
- `CloomTests/WaveformNoiseFloorTests.swift`
- `CloomTests/AudioChunkingTests.swift`

**Milestone verified:** 149 new tests (141 Swift + 7 Rust + 1 updated). Total: 198 Swift tests in 30 suites + 50 Rust tests. All pass. Build succeeds. Bug fix: cuts at start of timeline now handled correctly in EditorCompositionBuilder.

---

## Phase 25B: Fix Subtitle Export
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-03
**PR:** [#37](https://github.com/iamsachin/cloom/pull/37)

- [x] Fixed subtitle export failure — see [BUGS.md #37](BUGS.md#37--subtitle-export-fails-with-the-operation-could-not-be-completed) for details
- [x] Simplified `ExportWriter.swift` and `ExportService.swift` (4 clear export paths)
- [x] Removed `[DEBUG]` log lines from export pipeline

**Milestone verified:** Export with subtitles succeeds. Export without subtitles (passthrough) still works. Build succeeds.

---

## Phase 25: Design Principles & Code Quality
**Status:** DONE

**Goal:** Fix SOLID, KISS, DRY violations and improve encapsulation, separation of concerns, and code organization identified in the design principles audit. Build succeeds + all existing tests pass + no regressions.

### Task 1 — Rust Safety Fixes (High Priority)
- [x] Fix UTF-8 byte-slice truncation panic in `cloom-core/src/ai/llm.rs` — use `char_indices()` instead of `&text[..MAX_CHARS]`
- [x] Fix TOCTOU file check in `cloom-core/src/ai/transcribe.rs` — replace `Path::exists()` with `File::open()` and real error propagation
- [x] Log decode errors in `cloom-core/src/audio/silence.rs` — added `log::warn!` instead of silent `Err(_) => continue`
- [x] Remove dead `ExportError` variant from `cloom-core/src/lib.rs`
- [x] Added test `test_truncate_multibyte_utf8_no_panic`

### Task 2 — DRY: Shared UI Components
- [x] Extract `AsyncThumbnailImage` component (`Shared/AsyncThumbnailImage.swift`) — moved `thumbnailCache` and async loading from `VideoCardView` and `LibraryListRowView`
- [x] Extract `CloudStatusBadgeView` (`Shared/CloudStatusBadgeView.swift`) — unified cloud status icon
- [x] Extract `Int64.formattedDuration` extension (`Shared/DurationFormatting.swift`)

### Task 3 — DRY: Service & Helper Extraction
- [x] Add `resetSegmentState()` to `RecordingCoordinator` — replaced 3 duplicated reset blocks
- [x] Create `NotificationService` (`Shared/NotificationService.swift`) — unified notification logic, fixed guard-condition inversion bug
- [x] Extract `AVMutableAudioMix.stereoMix(from:)` (`Shared/AudioMixBuilder.swift`) — deduplicated across `SegmentStitcher` (2x) and `EditorCompositionBuilder`
- [x] Extract `NSScreen.screen(for:)` (`Shared/NSScreen+DisplayID.swift`) — deduplicated in `ScreenCaptureService+Configuration` and `RecordingCoordinator+Webcam`
- [x] Extract `startCaptureWithCurrentConfig()` helper — deduplicated filter/mode capture start in `+Capture` and `+PauseResume`
- [x] Deduplicate OpenAI client construction in Rust — shared `make_openai_client()` in `ai/mod.rs`

### Task 4 — Separation of Concerns
- [x] Move `buildCaptionPhrases` and `groupTranscriptIntoSentences` off view types into `Shared/TranscriptGrouping.swift` — kept forwarding stubs on views for test compatibility
- [x] Extract `TranscriptPersistenceService` (`AI/TranscriptPersistenceService.swift`) — 85-line `persistResults` out of `AIOrchestrator`
- [x] Extract `VideoLibraryService` (`Library/VideoLibraryService.swift`) — file deletion/folder move out of `LibraryContentView`
- [x] `MenuBarView` already in separate `CloomApp.swift` (appropriate size) — no action needed

### Task 5 — Encapsulation & Architecture
- [x] Create `UserDefaultsKeys` enum (`Shared/UserDefaultsKeys.swift`) — 18 centralized keys, replaced raw strings across 13 files
- [x] Fix `AppState` facade bypass in `CloomApp.swift:88-89` — use wrapper methods instead of reaching through `.recordingCoordinator`
- [x] Make `AnnotationRenderer.ciContext` private — exposed `renderToBuffer(_:to:bounds:)` method, updated caller in `ScreenCaptureService+StreamOutput`
- [x] `thumbnailCache` moved to `AsyncThumbnailImage` in Task 2
- RecordingCoordinator private properties — skipped (Swift extensions in separate files cannot access `private`; would need file consolidation)
- Singleton access removal — skipped (significant architectural change requiring Environment/DI refactor)

### Task 6 — Rust Code Quality
- [x] Replace glob re-exports with explicit symbol exports in `lib.rs` — 12 symbols across 4 modules
- [x] Deduplicate provider `match` — extracted `dispatch_transcription()` in `transcribe.rs`
- [x] Extract `llm_from_transcript()` shared helper — deduplicates validate → truncate → format → complete preamble across 4 LLM functions

**New files added:**
- `CloomApp/Sources/Shared/AsyncThumbnailImage.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Shared/CloudStatusBadgeView.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Shared/DurationFormatting.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Shared/NotificationService.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Shared/AudioMixBuilder.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Shared/NSScreen+DisplayID.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Shared/TranscriptGrouping.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Shared/UserDefaultsKeys.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/Library/VideoLibraryService.swift`
- `CloomApp/Sources/AI/TranscriptPersistenceService.swift`

**Milestone verified:** Build succeeds (1 warning). 198 Swift tests in 30 suites + 44 Rust tests — all pass. No regressions.

---

**Milestone verified:** Build succeeds. 196 Swift tests pass.

---

## Phase 27: Pre-Release
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-03

### Key Decisions
- **No Apple Developer Program** — ad-hoc signing only (free)
- **No notarization** — users right-click → Open on first launch
- **Custom Homebrew tap** — `iamsachin/homebrew-cloom` (not official homebrew-cask)
- **GitHub Releases** for DMG hosting
- **Upgrade path**: add Developer ID + notarization later if needed

### Tasks
- [x] Task 81a — Ad-hoc code signing + DMG packaging (`scripts/release.sh`: archive → `codesign --sign -` → `create-dmg`)
- [x] Task 81b — GitHub Actions release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`: build Rust + Xcode → ad-hoc sign → DMG → GitHub Release → update Homebrew tap on `v*` tag)
- [x] Task 81c — Homebrew custom tap (created `iamsachin/homebrew-cloom` repo with `Casks/cloom.rb`, auto-updated by CI)
- [x] Task 81d — ExportOptions.plist for Xcode archive export (ad-hoc `mac-application` method)
- [x] Task 83 — `CHANGELOG.md` with full v0.1.0 feature list
- [x] Task 143 — `UpdateChecker` (@Observable): queries GitHub Releases API, semantic version compare, menu bar "Update Available" item, auto-checks on launch
- [x] Task 144 — `AboutSettingsTab`: 7th Settings tab with app icon, version, GitHub/Issues/License links, "Check for Updates" button

**New files:** `scripts/release.sh`, `ExportOptions.plist`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `CloomApp/Sources/App/UpdateChecker.swift`, `CloomApp/Sources/Settings/AboutSettingsTab.swift`, `CloomTests/UpdateCheckerTests.swift`

**Milestone verified:** Build succeeds (0 errors). 10 UpdateChecker tests pass. Homebrew tap live at github.com/iamsachin/homebrew-cloom.

---

## Phase 28: Sparkle Auto-Update
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-03-05

### Tasks
- [x] Task 170 — Added Sparkle 2.6+ SPM dependency to `project.yml`
- [x] Task 171 — Created `SparkleUpdater.swift`: `@MainActor ObservableObject` wrapping `SPUStandardUpdaterController`
- [x] Task 172 — Replaced `UpdateChecker` with Sparkle in `CloomApp.swift`, `MenuBarView`, and `AboutSettingsTab`
- [x] Task 173 — Added `SUFeedURL` and `SUPublicEDKey` to `Info.plist`
- [x] Task 174 — Generated EdDSA keypair (public key in Info.plist, private key in Keychain + `SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub secret)
- [x] Task 175 — Created `scripts/generate-appcast.sh` for appcast.xml generation
- [x] Task 176 — Updated CI release workflow: EdDSA DMG signing → appcast generation → gh-pages deployment
- [x] Task 177 — Created `gh-pages` branch with initial appcast.xml, GitHub Pages enabled at `https://iamsachin.github.io/cloom/appcast.xml`

**Deleted files:** `UpdateChecker.swift`
**New files:** `SparkleUpdater.swift`, `scripts/generate-appcast.sh`

**Milestone verified:** Build succeeds (1 warning). Sparkle auto-checks appcast every 24h on launch. "Check for Updates" in menu bar + About tab. CI signs DMGs and publishes appcast to GitHub Pages.

---

## Phase 29: Recording Details Display + Export Quality Fix
**Status:** In Progress
**Date:** 2026-03-27

### Bug Fix: Export Quality Picker
- [x] Task 178 — Added `recordingQuality` field to `VideoRecord`
- [x] Task 179 — Fixed `ExportService` to re-encode via `AVAssetExportSession` when export quality differs from recording quality
- [x] Task 180 — `EditorExportView` defaults quality picker to recording's actual quality

### Recording Details Display
- [x] Task 181 — Created `VideoMetadataLoader` helper (reads bitrate, codec, FPS, audio tracks from AVAsset)
- [x] Task 182 — Updated `EditorInfoPanel` with Details + Encoding sections (quality, recording type, codec, bitrate, FPS, audio tracks)
- [x] Task 183 — Added hover tooltip to `VideoCardView` (resolution, duration, file size, quality, type, date)
- [x] Task 184 — Added resolution and file size columns to `LibraryListRowView`
- [ ] Task 185 — Build verification

### New Files
- `CloomApp/Sources/Shared/VideoMetadataLoader.swift`
